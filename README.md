![TOMMY HUD — Idle](screenshots/hero.jpg)

A Windows-native, voice-first AI personal assistant inspired by JARVIS from Iron Man — built from scratch in Python and a single HTML file. Renamed Tommy because, well, he's my mate.

Lives quietly in the background. Wakes on **"Hey TOMMY"**. Speaks in a neural British voice. Manages your day, runs your code, hacks your hashes, and reads your calendar — all through one Iron Man–style HUD.

> Built it for myself. Sharing because I'd want to see it if someone else built it.

## What it can do

### Voice & Brain
- 🎙 **Always-on wake word** — "Hey TOMMY" from anywhere; works even when the browser tab is closed
- 🧠 **Groq-powered** — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` for thinking, `llama-4-scout` for vision
- 🗣 **Neural TTS** — Microsoft edge-tts `en-GB-RyanNeural`
- 🛑 **"Stop" command** — cuts speech instantly

### Personal Assistant
- 📅 **Google Calendar** — speaks today + tomorrow's events on every boot; warns 15 min before each meeting
- 📬 **Gmail Primary** — reads important unread; filters out Promotions, Social, Updates, Forums, Spam
- ✅ **Tasks + reminders** — natural-language "remind me to X at 5 PM"
- 📝 **Notes + journal** — `#tags` parsed; "notes from yesterday", "search notes for X"
- 🔐 **Password vault** — DPAPI-encrypted (Windows user-locked, no master password)
- 💬 **WhatsApp messaging** — "send a WhatsApp to Dev saying I'll be late"
- 🎵 **Spotify control** — "play lo-fi", "next song", "pause" (auto-launches Spotify if not running)
- 🎯 **Workflow modes** — "study mode", "gaming mode", "CTF mode" trigger multi-step action chains

### Cybersecurity
- 🔓 **Hashes** — identify, generate (MD5/SHA/NTLM/MD4), dictionary-crack
- 🔄 **Encode/decode** — base64, hex, URL, rot13, morse, binary
- 🐛 **CVE intel** — `lookup CVE-2024-3094` (NVD), "recent critical CVEs"
- 🌐 **Subdomain enumeration** — crt.sh + hackertarget fallback
- 🐙 **GitHub dorking** — pre-baked search URLs for AWS keys, .env files, SSH keys
- 💥 **Reverse shell payloads** — 10 languages (Bash, Python, PowerShell, Perl, Ruby, …)
- 🔍 **Port scan, DNS, HTTP headers, ping** — 42-port TCP probe
- 📡 **WiFi password recovery** — own networks via `netsh`
- 👁 **Screen vision** — Groq vision analyzes screenshots ("look at my screen and solve this")

### Drag, Drop, Done
- 📎 **Click 📎, drag-and-drop, or paste Ctrl+V** to attach images / code / text
- Images go to Groq vision for analysis
- Text/code files are appended to your prompt

### Code Engine
- 💻 **"Write and run a python script that scans port 80 on 10 IPs"** — generates, saves, executes
- Python, PowerShell, Batch, Node, HTML

### Proactive Alerts
- 🔋 Battery (<20% / <10% warnings)
- 💾 RAM (>90% pressure)
- 🌡 CPU (sustained >95%)
- All speak unprompted with sensible cooldowns (8–25 min)

### The HUD
- Pure black background with neon accent that shifts hue per state (white → magenta → orange → green)
- Real-time FFT frequency bars on the orb, driven by your live mic input
- Live CPU/RAM/disk/network/power graphs, scrolling telemetry
- Code blocks with one-click COPY button
- Typewriter animation on TOMMY replies
- Animated grid background, drifting scan beam, wake-flash on activation

---

## The HUD reacts to TOMMY's state

The entire interface — orb, panels, frequency bars, brand mark, status pill, scan beam — shifts hue together depending on what TOMMY is doing.

| Standby (white) | Listening (magenta) | Speaking (lime) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ![Standby](screenshots/hero.jpg) | ![Listening](screenshots/hud-listening.jpg) | ![Speaking](screenshots/hud-speaking.jpg) |
| idle, awaiting orders | mic engaged, capturing voice | answering, mid-reply |

There's also a fourth state — **PROCESSING** (electric orange) — that flashes for the second or two TOMMY spends thinking before it speaks.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Requirements
- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.11 ([download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/))
- A microphone
- A free [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (sign up with Google)

### 1. Clone the repo
```bat
git clone https://github.com/Maher-Bhatt/Tommy.git C:\Tommy
cd C:\Tommy
```

### 2. Create your config
```bat
copy config.example.py config.py
notepad config.py
```

In `config.py`, paste your Groq API key:
```python
GROQ_API_KEY = "gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Also set:
```python
OWNER_NAME    = "YourName"
OWNER_TITLE   = "Sir"        # what TOMMY should call you
OWNER_CITY    = "YourCity"   # for weather
```

### 3. Install dependencies
Double-click **`INSTALL.bat`** — or run:
```bat
py -3.11 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `pyaudio` fails to build (rare):
```bat
py -3.11 -m pip install pipwin && py -3.11 -m pipwin install pyaudio
```

### 4. Launch
Double-click **`START.bat`** — within 2 seconds you'll hear TOMMY greet you, and Chrome opens to `http://localhost:8888`.

That's it. Say **"Hey TOMMY, what time is it"** to test.

### 5. (optional) Auto-start on every Windows boot
```bat
py -3.11 launcher.py
```
This registers TOMMY under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` and drops a Startup-folder shortcut as backup. TOMMY will now launch silently every time you log in.

To undo: open `regedit`, delete `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\TOMMY_v5`.

---

## Optional integrations (set up only what you want)

### Google Calendar + Gmail
1. Go to **[console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)** → Create a project
2. APIs & Services → Library → enable **Google Calendar API** and **Gmail API**
3. OAuth consent screen → External → fill basics → add your Gmail as a **test user**
4. Credentials → Create Credentials → **OAuth client ID** → **Desktop app**
5. Download the JSON → save as `data\google_credentials.json`
6. Run: `py -3.11 setup_google.py`
7. Browser opens → click your Gmail → Allow. Done. Token cached forever.

### Spotify
1. Go to **[developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)** → Create app
2. **Redirect URI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8889/callback` (exact)
3. Tick **Web API**, agree to ToS, Save
4. Copy **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into `config.py`:
   ```python
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID     = "..."
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "..."
   ```
5. Run: `py -3.11 setup_spotify.py`
6. Browser opens → Allow.

### WhatsApp
Just open `https://web.whatsapp.com` in Chrome once and scan the QR. After that TOMMY can send messages through it.

Add contacts:
> *"Hey TOMMY, add contact Dev +919876543210"*

Send messages:
> *"Hey TOMMY, send WhatsApp to Dev saying I'll be late"*

### Hash cracking
Drop a wordlist at `data\wordlist.txt` (e.g., rockyou.txt) and TOMMY can crack hashes:
> *"Hey TOMMY, crack hash 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"*

```

**Why stdlib only for the server?** No Flask, no FastAPI, no npm — TOMMY depends on Python's `http.server` + `ThreadingMixIn` and a single HTML file. Easier to audit, faster to start, no build step.

`data/` is created automatically on first run and holds your local state (memory, tasks, vault, tokens). It's `.gitignore`d — your secrets never leak.

## Troubleshooting

**TOMMY doesn't greet me on launch.** Make sure your speakers are unmuted and `START.bat` shows no errors. If pygame fails, reinstall: `pip install --force-reinstall pygame`.

**Wake word "Hey TOMMY" doesn't work.** Google STT needs internet. Check that `data/listener.log` says "listening". Also: Windows privacy → Microphone → make sure desktop apps can use it.

**Spotify says "no active device".** Open Spotify (desktop or web player or phone) and hit play on any song for 2 seconds. TOMMY will auto-launch Spotify if it's not running, but Spotify still needs to register a device first.

**Server unreachable in browser.** Check Task Manager for `pythonw.exe` processes. If none, run `START.bat` again. The Windows Firewall may prompt the first time — click Allow.

**Groq quota exceeded.** The free tier is 6,000 requests/day on the 70B model — should be plenty. If exceeded, TOMMY falls back to Ollama (if you have it installed) or just says it's unavailable.
